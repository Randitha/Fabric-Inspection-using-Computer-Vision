# Fabric-Inspection-using-Computer-Vision
A real-time web-based fabric inspection system using YOLOv8 and FastAPI. Trained on a custom dataset (RuRa) combining real-world factory defects and TILDA data, the system detects holes, slubs, foreign yarn, and surface contamination with high accuracy, computes fault rates, and generates inspection reports.
